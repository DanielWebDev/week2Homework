# Create a todo list app using node and the __prompt__ library.  Make sure you set the project up as a new node/git/github project.  After doing your initial npm init you can install the prompt library via __npm install prompt --save__

# You should be able to do the following "script" in your todo list:

# 	1. run node todo.js
# 	2. select 1 of 3 options from a printed list:  Print ToDo, Add ToDo, Complete Todo
# 	3. When selecting Print ToDo, a ordered list of added todo options should be displayed... and then the menu options should be printed again
# 	4. When selecting Add ToDo you should be instructed to type a todo item and hit enter to add it. After following instructions the menu option should be printed again.
# 	5. When selecting Complete todo, instructions on selecting todo item to be removed should be presented.  After following instructions the menu option should be printed again.
